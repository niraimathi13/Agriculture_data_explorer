# Agriculture data explorer : Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA

This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization platform that integrates agricultural data from various Indian states and districts. The platform will showcase key insights into crop production, yield efficiency, and cultivated areas through intuitive charts and dashboards. By revealing regional trends and disparities, it will assist farmers in selecting optimal crops, enable policymakers to identify areas requiring attention, and support researchers in analyzing agricultural patterns and outcomes.

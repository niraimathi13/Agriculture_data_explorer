# Agriculture data explorer : Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA

This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization platform that integrates agricultural data from various Indian states and districts. The platform will showcase key insights into crop production, yield efficiency, and cultivated areas through intuitive charts and dashboards. By revealing regional trends and disparities, it will assist farmers in selecting optimal crops, enable policymakers to identify areas requiring attention, and support researchers in analyzing agricultural patterns and outcomes.

## Features

- Interactive Dashboards: Visualize crop production,yield and area across states and districts.
- Crop Comparison Tool: Compare multiple crops side-by-side by region and performance.
- State & District level insights: Drill down from national to local data.
- Time Series analysis: Track changes over years to identify trends and patterns.
- Policy support Tools: Identify low yield regions for targeted interventions.
- Exportable reports: Download insights as PDF or Excel for sharing.
- User friendly interface: Clean,responsive design for all users.
- Role-Based access: Custom views for farmers,researchers and policymakers.

## Business use cases
#### Farmers:

- Use Case 1: A farmer can explore historical crop production and yield data to make informed decisions on which crops to cultivate in different seasons based on past performance.
- Use Case 2: The farmer can analyze regional productivity and identify potential areas for improvement, such as soil health or irrigation practices.

#### Policymakers:

- Use Case 1: Government officials can use the platform to assess regions with low productivity and allocate resources or subsidies to improve crop yields and farmer livelihoods.
- Use Case 2: Identifying crops with fluctuating yields to develop better policy for crop insurance and risk management.

#### Researchers:

- Use Case 1: Researchers can use the platform to analyze the impact of climate, soil, and irrigation on crop yields over time.
- Use Case 2: The platform can help researchers identify potential areas for agricultural innovation, such as high-yielding varieties or pest management techniques.
